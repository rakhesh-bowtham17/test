# Proper Folder Structure

## Use a separate folder for assets
•	Use a separate folder for assets such as images or fonts in src folder. 


## Authentication:
•	Authentication is to can authenticate their credentials to verify that they are a valid user.
•	In our project we are going to  use  jwt token to make sure only the valid users enters and access the resources.



## Components:
•	The "components" folder is a useful way to organize and manage the reusable UI components.
•	We should have a SubFolder for each component and the styles for a particular component should be mentioned along with that
•	For example:
•	Button: A reusable button component that can be used to trigger actions or navigate to different parts of the application.
•	Props:
•	text (string) - the text to display on the button (required)
•	onClick (function) - the function to call when the button is clicked



## Containers:
•	The containers folder is used as a way to organize and group together container components in a React application, making it easier to manage and maintain the code.
•	In our project we have containers like menu ,table ,forms where in we use the same container in different pages thus code reusability is achieved.



## Constants:
•	Constants variable name should contain only capital letters
•	The constants folder is store commonly used variables or values that are unlikely to change during runtime. These variables are often used across multiple components.
•	In our project we store values like the header value and the default amount that has to be given to each user.




## env files:
•	These  files can include sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other secrets.
•	We should not share this file
•	In our project we use env file to store the API_URL’s 
•   API keys or URLs for development and production environments. By using a .env file, you can set different values for these variables in each environment without modifying the code. 
•   The values in the .env file can be modified without changing the code itself, which makes it easier to manage different environments, such as development, staging, and production.




## Pages:
•	This folder contains React components that represent the different pages of your application.
•	In our project we have different pages like Dashboard, Reports, stats



## Utilis:
•	Utilities or utility functions are typically used to perform common, reusable tasks that are not specific to a particular component or module in your application.


## Globals:
•	The globals  folder is used to store global variables, constants, or utility functions that are used throughout the application.
•	We use global images and styles that are used throughout the application
•   It Defines a set of global styles using the styled-components library for a web page.
•   It sets the font family for the body element, the color and text decoration for links, and the background color, text color, and other styles for buttons.
•   It also defines a custom style using the styled-components library, which is then exported as a default module


## Services:
•	This folder is usually organized in a way that groups related services together.
•	In our project we use this function to  handles API requests and responses
