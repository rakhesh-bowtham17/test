# Project Naming Conventions
## Folder Naming

Use lowercase for folder names.
Use a single, descriptive word or a short phrase to name your folders.
Avoid using spaces or special characters in folder names. Instead, use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) to separate words.
For example, use "services", "pages", "components".

## File Naming

Use Pascal Case for file names.
If the file contains a React component, use the same name as the component name. For example, Button.js for a component named Button.
Use Pascal Case for naming Components File other than that use CamelCase.
If the file does not contain a React component, use a descriptive name that accurately reflects the purpose of the file. For example, utils.js for a file containing utility functions.

## Component Naming

Component Naming
Use Pascal Case for naming your components. This means that the first letter of each word in the component name should be capitalized, and there should be no underscores or hyphens.
Avoid using generic names for components

## Prop Naming

Prop Naming
Use camelCase for naming your props.
Avoid using generic names like "data" or "value" for your props.
